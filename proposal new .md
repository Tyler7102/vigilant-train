# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Canto Bight Blackjack

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Star Wars themed blackjack game

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a blackjack game that's themed after the casino planet in Star Wars. I plan on (most likely) making this with Unity, which I've looked into. It's going to be 2D and will have a dealer that's probably going to be different pngs of a character. The game mechanics will be standard and follow your typical blackjack game behavior. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
I do not

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Just me

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will have a basic blackjack game that's setup properly, even if there is not a star wars theme

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A blackjack game that works completely and has heavy themes related to Star Wars

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The same as listed above, but possibly even dialogue from the dealer and more littel details that are fun to look at amd keep things fresh

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I definitely need to familiarize myself with Unity because I've never used it before. I need to gather my templates as well for cards and other visual features that have to be added to the game. Focusing on the foundation is key, and then later on I'll definitely add as much detail as I can, but locking in the game mechanics is the most important part.
